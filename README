Due date:
    11/12/2025 @ 11:59pm (test and t0)
    11/14/2025 @ 11:59pm (everything working)


Assignment:

    - learn how to program in Go
    - finish the implementation of an over-simplified network simulation
    - donate a test case <csid>.go, <csid>.ok

The switch simulator:

    - runs on top of simple switch simulator with parameterized failure
      modes: https://github.com/cs439t-f25/layer2.

    - you can browse the source code for the switch but you don't
      have to clone it. Your assignment repo will do that for you
      by importing it.

    - you can submit pull requests to add documentation, fix typos
      fix bugs, etc. Not required but highly appreciated.

Your submission:

    - uses the switch simulator to implement TCP-like, full-duplex
      byte streams.

    - Look at the layer2.Mgr interface for a description of the
      2 functions you need to implement.

Rules:

    - All network communications should go through the switch

    - You can only use shared memory and other side-channels for
      debugging purposes.

    - You can use the standard Go "log" package to print debug
      and other informative messages. Use of "stdout" should
      be limited to the expected test output

    - Please try to preserve the use of WaitGroup and the timeout
      mechanism used in t0.go.

    - Your implementation should go in the impl package

    - Your test case should not rely on any of the implementation
      details; only the signature of the impl.NewMgr function and
      the public interfaces defined in layer2.

    - Add ~gheith/public/go/bin to your PATH in order to pick an up
      to date release of Golang.
